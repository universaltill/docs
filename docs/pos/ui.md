# POS UI

Status:
- UI works but quality is a known gap (per user note).
- Uses HTML/HTMX; themable.

To document:
- Current screens/flows and pain points.
- Desired improvements for MVP.
- Accessibility/responsiveness targets.
- Alignment with plugin capabilities once marketplace/CLI flow is enabled.
