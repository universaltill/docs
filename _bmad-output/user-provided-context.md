# User-Provided Context (Documentation Workflow)

## Key guidance from Farshid

- This is a **multi-repo** project:
  - POS: `~/repos/unitill/universal-till`
  - Marketplace: `~/repos/unitill/ut-market-place`
  - Sample plugin: `~/repos/unitill/ut-plugin-faq`
- All documentation should be centralized in: `~/repos/unitill/docs`
- Current known gaps / priorities:
  - POS MVP works but UI quality needs improvement.
  - Marketplace runs, but plugin add/install flow is missing or incomplete; CLI dependency is a key blocker.
  - FAQ plugin is waiting on CLI/install flow to test end-to-end.
