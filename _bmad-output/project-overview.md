# Project Overview: Universal Till (Multi-Repo)

Universal Till is an offline-first, open-source, plugin-first POS platform designed to run on inexpensive hardware and support a marketplace of extensions. This workspace contains multiple repositories (POS, marketplace, plugins) and a centralized docs hub.

## Repository Structure

**Type:** Multi-part / multi-repo workspace  
**Scan root:** `~/repos/unitill`  
**Docs hub:** `~/repos/unitill/docs`

Primary repos:
- POS: `~/repos/unitill/universal-till`
- Marketplace: `~/repos/unitill/ut-market-place`
- Sample plugin: `~/repos/unitill/ut-plugin-faq`

## Tech Stack Summary

- **Language:** Go (POS Go 1.25, marketplace Go 1.25.3, plugin Go 1.21)
- **POS storage:** SQLite
- **Marketplace API:** gRPC + REST gateway (gRPC-Gateway)
- **Marketplace data model:** Ent ORM
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry + Prometheus (marketplace)
- **Localization:** POS locales in `web/locales`, marketplace locales in `locales/`, plugin supports RTL locales

## Key Platform Ideas (Product Brief)

- Offline-first core POS that works with unreliable/no internet.
- Runs anywhere, including low-cost devices.
- “Everything is a plugin”: taxes, compliance, payments, integrations, and vertical workflows.
- Plugin marketplace for discovery, trust tiers, versioning, and install/health tracking.
- Free core with optional paid cloud services later (sync, backups, analytics, remote management).
- Future: consumer map app and global item identity (not MVP).

## Documentation Outputs

Core outputs (generated by documentation workflow):
- `project-structure.md`
- `project-parts-metadata.md`
- `technology-stack.md`
- `architecture-patterns.md`
- `source-tree-analysis.md`
- `development-guide.md`
- `integration-architecture.md`
- Architecture per part: `architecture-pos.md`, `architecture-marketplace.md`, `architecture-plugin-faq.md`
- APIs: `api-contracts-*.md`
- Data models: `data-models-*.md`

## Next Steps

- Generate master `_bmad-output/index.md` to act as the primary AI retrieval entrypoint.
- Use this index as input to BMAD PRD and story workflows.
